## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

In order to connect to the WooCommerce API, you'll need to configure your API settings in the `app.config.js` file. Here's how to do it:

1. Locate the `app.config.js` file in your project directory.

2. Open `app.config.js` in a text editor.

3. Update the configuration with your WooCommerce API credentials. You may need to obtain these credentials from your WooCommerce store:

   ```javascript
   API_URL = "https://your-site.domain/";
   CONSUMER_KEY = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY";
   CONSUMER_SECRET = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET";
   ```

4. Save the `app.config.js` file.

## Usage

Now that you have configured the WooCommerce API, you can start using it in your React.js application. You can make API calls to retrieve product information, customer data, orders, and more. You can find example code and usage in the project's source code.

To start your React.js application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Your React app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. or terminal shown url.
